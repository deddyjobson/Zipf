# Zipf
Shows the occurrence of the Zipf phenomenon in languages

According to Zipf, the number of occurences of all the words in any randomly chosen passage will be similar to the equation y = c/x.

Though this is true for any language, here, I have only tried it for English to test out the tesseract library.
